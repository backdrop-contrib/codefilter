This is a simple filter module. It handles <code></code> and <?php ?> tags so
that users can post code without having to worry about escaping with &lt; and
&gt;

Installation
------------

1. Copy the codefilter folder to the Drupal modules/ directory, so that all
   files are in modules/codefilter.

3. (optionally) Go to administer > filters > ordering and
   rearrange the filter order to resolve filter conflicts.
